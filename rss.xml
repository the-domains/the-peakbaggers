            <title><![CDATA[We crossed a lake as it broke off into a stream. It was cold but the water had been lowered thanks to Nova Scotia Hydro doing work on the other side. How we would have made this without a boat otherwise, we don't know, but we took a moment to soak it all in. What is your favorite memory of chance? 🌾🌾🌾 @visitnovascotia #novascotia #travel #capebreton #hiking #highpoints #peakbagging #journey #getoutside #adventure #outdoors #webseries #doc]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[After an 11 hour hike to basecamp we basically ran as fast we could - bushwhacking - up the 3.2km to Ishpatina Ridge last May. We couldn't wait to see the tower, up close and personal. We couldn't wait to bag this peak, this mountain, one that defeated us wholeheartedly a couple months earlier. Back at basecamp, we were tired, our shoulders were sore, but we were stoked. We have a story to tell, and we're proud of this one. 👌🏾🌲💛 #webseries #documentary #ontario #canada #explorecanada #staytuned #outdoors #adventure #doc #nature #getoutside #hiking #backcountry #discoveryourwild]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[When 2 of 3 of us got to base camp at Ishpatina Ridge we went to work building a fire and setting up the tent so when our third team member arrived (we hoped he'd arrive) there would be a warm fire for him to dry off. Why were we separated? Why was he wet? We'll lay it all out for you March 25th with episode 1.

            <title><![CDATA[When we arrived at Ishpatina we hit a road block: an unplowed road. But thanks to the gracious understanding in the name of adventure from a local trapper, we were sledded into the wild on the back of his snow machine. It was like we were given permission to begin, and we tried our best to channel this trapper's energy and confidence on these paths as best we could. 🌲💪🏽💛 Episode 1 coming March 25th. #documentary #webseries #outdoors #adventure #staytuned #doc #ontario #nature #getoutside #snowshoe #hiking #backcountry #winter #discoveryourwild]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[We looked at a map and had our starting point: the Sturgeon River crossing. But it was March and -23*C. The road, when we arrived, was covered in 5 feet of snow. That meant a 23.5km snowshoe. We knew that, on average, with all our gear, we'd move at 2km/hr. It would take us 12 hours to snowshoe to our starting point and it was already 11am. What do we do?

            <title><![CDATA[Brett Kibbler is one half of a really funny video series called @checkforknives. He's an Ontario native with an extensive background in film and audio production. Brett went to post-secondary school on the west coast school and there he ran a successful video company where he created a variety of outdoor films. Back in Toronto he started an audio company recording a variety of musicians including a Toronto lo-fi indie group HiFi Phantom in which he played virtually every instrument. The band was highly received in the city and is very much missed! (You can find them on @cbc_music!) You're probably wondering why we're telling you all about Brett. Well, he's the newest edition of our team. Brett is our editor and he's here to help us bring you Episode 1 of The Peakbaggers! We are thrilled to have Brett on board to help us tell our story! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 #documentary #doc #webseries #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #profile #editor #teammate #bio #peakbagging #hiking #ontario #survival]]></title>
