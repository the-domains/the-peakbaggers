            <title><![CDATA[Those moments when you decide to do something - to go - and you don't realize that you'll be forever changed because of simply saying "yes." We committed to one goal and we've been working hard to achieve it. Here we are at the base of a logging road in Northern Ontario about to be dropped via snow machine leaving us a two day's snowshoe away from our car. This, we knew. What was about to happen, we did not. Episode 1 is coming to you March 25th. #staytuned #documentary #webseries #ontario #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #snowshoe #hiking #backcountry #winter #discoveryourwild]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[When we got to the top of the lookout tower at Baldy Mountain, Manitoba's highest peak, thunder roared above us. We were completely alone. It was windy and we were tired from the hot and sticky night we had amongst rural campers and massive mosquitos at Blue Lake. But we were thrilled to be there: a place we had never conceived of going to until this project fell in our laps. We hiked the accompanying trail as the rain clouds drew in, heavy above us. We were only there for a couple hours, but we made a memory that will last us forever. It rained, oh it rained, and we stood in it; happy to be alive.🌲⛰💛 @travelmanitoba #manitoba #canada #peakbagging #hiking #adventure #getoutside #goals #nature #outdoors #thunder #happiness #inreach #inreachcanada]]></title>
