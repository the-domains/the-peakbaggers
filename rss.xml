Often being outside in the wild is all about solitude but the journey you go on can be a profound one, made even better by conversation.

            <title><![CDATA[We crossed a lake as it broke off into a stream. It was cold but the water had been lowered thanks to Nova Scotia Hydro doing work on the other side. How we would have made this without a boat otherwise, we don't know, but we took a moment to soak it all in. What is your favorite memory of chance? 🌾🌾🌾 @visitnovascotia #novascotia #travel #capebreton #hiking #highpoints #peakbagging #journey #getoutside #adventure #outdoors #webseries #doc]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[After an 11 hour hike to basecamp we basically ran as fast we could - bushwhacking - up the 3.2km to Ishpatina Ridge last May. We couldn't wait to see the tower, up close and personal. We couldn't wait to bag this peak, this mountain, one that defeated us wholeheartedly a couple months earlier. Back at basecamp, we were tired, our shoulders were sore, but we were stoked. We have a story to tell, and we're proud of this one. 👌🏾🌲💛 #webseries #documentary #ontario #canada #explorecanada #staytuned #outdoors #adventure #doc #nature #getoutside #hiking #backcountry #discoveryourwild]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[When 2 of 3 of us got to base camp at Ishpatina Ridge we went to work building a fire and setting up the tent so when our third team member arrived (we hoped he'd arrive) there would be a warm fire for him to dry off. Why were we separated? Why was he wet? We'll lay it all out for you March 25th with episode 1.
