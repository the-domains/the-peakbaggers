            <title><![CDATA[When 2 of 3 of us got to base camp at Ishpatina Ridge we went to work building a fire and setting up the tent so when our third team member arrived (we hoped he'd arrive) there would be a warm fire for him to dry off. Why were we separated? Why was he wet? We'll lay it all out for you March 25th with episode 1.

            <title><![CDATA[When we arrived at Ishpatina we hit a road block: an unplowed road. But thanks to the gracious understanding in the name of adventure from a local trapper, we were sledded into the wild on the back of his snow machine. It was like we were given permission to begin, and we tried our best to channel this trapper's energy and confidence on these paths as best we could. 🌲💪🏽💛 Episode 1 coming March 25th. #documentary #webseries #outdoors #adventure #staytuned #doc #ontario #nature #getoutside #snowshoe #hiking #backcountry #winter #discoveryourwild]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[We looked at a map and had our starting point: the Sturgeon River crossing. But it was March and -23*C. The road, when we arrived, was covered in 5 feet of snow. That meant a 23.5km snowshoe. We knew that, on average, with all our gear, we'd move at 2km/hr. It would take us 12 hours to snowshoe to our starting point and it was already 11am. What do we do? Episode 1 on March 25th. ❄️🙈❄️ #staytuned #documentary #webseries #ontario #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #snowshoe #hiking #backcountry #winter #discoveryourwild]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Brett Kibbler is one half of a really funny video series called @checkforknives. He's an Ontario native with an extensive background in film and audio production. Brett went to post-secondary school on the west coast school and there he ran a successful video company where he created a variety of outdoor films. Back in Toronto he started an audio company recording a variety of musicians including a Toronto lo-fi indie group HiFi Phantom in which he played virtually every instrument. The band was highly received in the city and is very much missed! (You can find them on @cbc_music!) You're probably wondering why we're telling you all about Brett. Well, he's the newest edition of our team. Brett is our editor and he's here to help us bring you Episode 1 of The Peakbaggers! We are thrilled to have Brett on board to help us tell our story! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 #documentary #doc #webseries #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #profile #editor #teammate #bio #peakbagging #hiking #ontario #survival]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[.@andrea_was began this project as producer and videographer (@aspacefilms). She was all in to tell a story about two men doing something radical and ambitious. But that quickly changed. As she grew more entangled in the plans, training, and energy of the project she begged herself to give herself a larger role. She noticed a gender imbalance, too, and this motivated her. In a project that tells the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things, she wanted to show that womyn are right beside the men, and not just hiding behind a camera. We crave the same sights, adventures, and successes. Andrea has now summitted all 6 peaks to date and is learning to ski before taking to the mountains for some serious training. @ThePeakbaggers is about taking an idea and making it actionable. It's about showcasing that anyone can do it, one foot in front of the other. We're thrilled to share our story with you, and we'd love to hear yours. Don't be strangers! ✋🏽🌲👌🏾#documentary #doc #webseries #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #profile #teammate #bio #peakbagging #hiking #ontario #survival]]></title>

We committed to one goal and we've been working hard to achieve it.

            <title><![CDATA[When we got to the top of the lookout tower at Baldy Mountain, Manitoba's highest peak, thunder roared above us. We were completely alone. It was windy and we were tired from the hot and sticky night we had amongst rural campers and massive mosquitos at Blue Lake. But we were thrilled to be there: a place we had never conceived of going to until this project fell in our laps. We hiked the accompanying trail as the rain clouds drew in, heavy above us. We were only there for a couple hours, but we made a memory that will last us forever. It rained, oh it rained, and we stood in it; happy to be alive.🌲⛰💛 @travelmanitoba #manitoba #canada #peakbagging #hiking #adventure #getoutside #goals #nature #outdoors #thunder #happiness #inreach #inreachcanada]]></title>
