title: "Brett Kibbler is one half of a really funny video series called @checkforknives. He's an Ontario native with an extensive background in film and audio production. Brett went to post-secondary school on the west coast school and there he ran a successful video company where he created a variety of outdoor films. Back in Toronto he started an audio company recording a variety of musicians including a Toronto lo-fi indie group HiFi Phantom in which he played virtually every instrument. The band was highly received in the city and is very much missed! (You can find them on @cbc_music!) You're probably wondering why we're telling you all about Brett. Well, he's the newest edition of our team. Brett is our editor and he's here to help us bring you Episode 1 of The Peakbaggers! We are thrilled to have Brett on board to help us tell our story! \uD83D\uDC4F\uD83C\uDFFC\uD83D\uDC4F\uD83C\uDFFC\uD83D\uDC4F\uD83C\uDFFC\uD83D\uDC4F\uD83C\uDFFC #documentary #doc #webseries #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #profile #editor #teammate #bio #peakbagging #hiking #ontario #survival"
