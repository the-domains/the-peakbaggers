title: ".@andrea_was began this project as producer and videographer (@aspacefilms). She was all in to tell a story about two men doing something radical and ambitious. But that quickly changed. As she grew more entangled in the plans, training, and energy of the project she begged herself to give herself a larger role. She noticed a gender imbalance, too, and this motivated her. In a project that tells the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things, she wanted to show that womyn are right beside the men, and not just hiding behind a camera. We crave the same sights, adventures, and successes. Andrea has now summitted all 6 peaks to date and is learning to ski before taking to the mountains for some serious training. @ThePeakbaggers is about taking an idea and making it actionable. It's about showcasing that anyone can do it, one foot in front of the other. We're thrilled to share our story with you, and we'd love to hear yours. Don't be strangers! ✋\uD83C\uDFFD\uD83C\uDF32\uD83D\uDC4C\uD83C\uDFFE#documentary #doc #webseries #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #profile #teammate #bio #peakbagging #hiking #ontario #survival"
