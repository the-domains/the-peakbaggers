title: "When 2 of 3 of us got to base camp at Ishpatina Ridge we went to work building a fire and setting up the tent so when our third team member arrived (we hoped he'd arrive) there would be a warm fire for him to dry off. Why were we separated? Why was he wet? We'll lay it all out for you March 25th with episode 1. Stay tuned! ❄️❄️❄️ #documentary #webseries #winter #staytuned #outdoors #adventure #doc #ontario #nature #getoutside #snowshoe #hiking #backcountry #discoveryourwild"
