title: "Those moments when you decide to do something - to go - and you don't realize that you'll be forever changed because of simply saying \"yes.\" We committed to one goal and we've been working hard to achieve it. Here we are at the base of a logging road in Northern Ontario about to be dropped via snow machine leaving us a two day's snowshoe away from our car. This, we knew. What was about to happen, we did not. Episode 1 is coming to you March 25th. #staytuned #documentary #webseries #ontario #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #snowshoe #hiking #backcountry #winter #discoveryourwild"
