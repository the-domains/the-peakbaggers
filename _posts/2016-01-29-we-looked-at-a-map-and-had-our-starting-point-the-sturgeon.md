title: "We looked at a map and had our starting point: the Sturgeon River crossing. But it was March and -23*C. The road, when we arrived, was covered in 5 feet of snow. That meant a 23.5km snowshoe. We knew that, on average, with all our gear, we'd move at 2km/hr. It would take us 12 hours to snowshoe to our starting point and it was already 11am. What do we do? Episode 1 on March 25th. ❄️\uD83D\uDE48❄️ #staytuned #documentary #webseries #ontario #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #snowshoe #hiking #backcountry #winter #discoveryourwild"
