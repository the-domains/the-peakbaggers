title: "We crossed a lake as it broke off into a stream. It was cold but the water had been lowered thanks to Nova Scotia Hydro doing work on the other side.

What is your favorite memory of chance? \uD83C\uDF3E\uD83C\uDF3E\uD83C\uDF3E @visitnovascotia #novascotia #travel #capebreton #hiking #highpoints #peakbagging #journey #getoutside #adventure #outdoors #webseries #doc"
