title: "When we got to the top of the lookout tower at Baldy Mountain, Manitoba's highest peak, thunder roared above us. We were completely alone. It was windy and we were tired from the hot and sticky night we had amongst rural campers and massive mosquitos at Blue Lake. But we were thrilled to be there: a place we had never conceived of going to until this project fell in our laps. We hiked the accompanying trail as the rain clouds drew in, heavy above us. We were only there for a couple hours, but we made a memory that will last us forever. It rained, oh it rained, and we stood in it; happy to be alive.\uD83C\uDF32⛰\uD83D\uDC9B @travelmanitoba #manitoba #canada #peakbagging #hiking #adventure #getoutside #goals #nature #outdoors #thunder #happiness #inreach #inreachcanada"
