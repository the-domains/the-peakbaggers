title: "After an 11 hour hike to basecamp we basically ran as fast we could - bushwhacking - up the 3.2km to Ishpatina Ridge last May. We couldn't wait to see the tower, up close and personal. We couldn't wait to bag this peak, this mountain, one that defeated us wholeheartedly a couple months earlier. Back at basecamp, we were tired, our shoulders were sore, but we were stoked. We have a story to tell, and we're proud of this one. \uD83D\uDC4C\uD83C\uDFFE\uD83C\uDF32\uD83D\uDC9B #webseries #documentary #ontario #canada #explorecanada #staytuned #outdoors #adventure #doc #nature #getoutside #hiking #backcountry #discoveryourwild"
