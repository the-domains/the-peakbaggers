He&#x27;s an Ontario native with an extensive background in film and audio production. Brett went to post-secondary school on the west coast school and there he ran a successful video company where he created a variety of outdoor films. Back in Toronto he started an audio company recording a variety of musicians including a Toronto lo-fi indie group HiFi Phantom in which he played virtually every instrument. The band was highly received in the city and is very much missed! (You can find them on @cbc_music!) You&#x27;re probably wondering why we&#x27;re telling you all about Brett. Well, he&#x27;s the newest edition of our team. Brett is our editor and he&#x27;s here to help us bring you Episode 1 of The Peakbaggers!

In childhood, Brian was diagnosed with and survived a brain tumour. Doctors told him he would never be able to play sports. But here he is, working hard on his balance, ability, and mental health - and kicking butt, too! His energy and ability to achieve hard, arduous goals is driving force of the series. Brian is proof that if you want something, there is a way to achieve it. 🙏🏽🔥💪🏽 #tough #documentary #doc #webseries #outdoors #nature #adventure #getoutside #profile #teammate #bio #peakbagging #beard #hiking #ontario #survival</span></h3><div class="Attribution color-title2 undefined" data-reactid="329"><h5 data-reactid="330"><span class="Author color-title2" data-reactid="331"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepeakbaggers" data-reactid="332">thepeakbaggers</a><!-- react-text: 333 --> / <!-- /react-text --><a href="http://https://www.instagram.com" data-reactid="334">Instagram</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 335 --></div></div></div><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="336"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 m-h-a" data-reactid="337"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BAPRqwOK0eD/?taken-by=thepeakbaggers" class="" data-reactid="338"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="339"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="340"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/46f58fea3315d1a1251e1fb23fb2bfcb/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbaf9900a01f81de5c3ebe1cd1bbd4d25a13cf1d4.jpg&amp;width=640" style="object-position:46.171875% 39.140625%;" data-reactid="341"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/46f58fea3315d1a1251e1fb23fb2bfcb/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbaf9900a01f81de5c3ebe1cd1bbd4d25a13cf1d4.jpg&amp;width=640" style="object-position:46.171875% 39.140625%;" data-reactid="342"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/46f58fea3315d1a1251e1fb23fb2bfcb/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbaf9900a01f81de5c3ebe1cd1bbd4d25a13cf1d4.jpg&amp;width=640" style="object-position:46.171875% 39.140625%;" data-reactid="343"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5adf4ac14f51e17685e244864e33600e/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbaf9900a01f81de5c3ebe1cd1bbd4d25a13cf1d4.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:46.171875% 39.140625%;" data-reactid="344"/><img class="color-loading" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/46f58fea3315d1a1251e1fb23fb2bfcb/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fbaf9900a01f81de5c3ebe1cd1bbd4d25a13cf1d4.jpg&amp;width=640" style="object-position:46.171875% 39.140625%;" data-reactid="345"/></picture></div></a><!-- react-empty: 346 --><div class="max-w-560px m-t-1" data-reactid="347"><!-- react-text: 348 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-empty: 349 --><h3 class="m-t-1 m-b-05 font-title undefined" data-reactid="350"><span data-reactid="351">.@andrea_was began this project as producer and videographer (@aspacefilms). She was all in to tell a story about two men doing something radical and ambitious. But that quickly changed. As she grew more entangled in the plans, training, and energy of the project she begged herself to give herself a larger role. She noticed a gender imbalance, too, and this motivated her. In a project that tells the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things, she wanted to show that womyn are right beside the men, and not just hiding behind a camera. We crave the same sights, adventures, and successes. Andrea has now summitted all 6 peaks to date and is learning to ski before taking to the mountains for some serious training. @ThePeakbaggers is about taking an idea and making it actionable. It&#x27;s about showcasing that anyone can do it, one foot in front of the other. We&#x27;re thrilled to share our story with you, and we&#x27;d love to hear yours.
